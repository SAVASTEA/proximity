I needed this to be a little more accurate and foolproof. I'm only using it to turn lights on and off when I enter and exit my home office, so there's been no extensive testing. Working fine for the time being, though.

* Using device RSSI check for reporting
* When a device first goes "missing," check 3 times over 6 seconds to make sure it's gone before running exit script

I played with using rawRSSI numbers, but it fluctuates too much to set an accurate threshold.
